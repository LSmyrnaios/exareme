# Local Exareme Deployment Guide

Here you will find all the information needed in order to deploy Exareme in your environment via Docker swarm and shell scripts.

# Requirement

1) Install Docker in your machine.

2) Since the deployment of a local instance of Exareme involves the creation of a Docker Swarm, you need to make sure that the node has:

- Static public IP
- Network configuration:
  * TCP: ports 2377 and 7946 must be open and available
  * UDP: ports 4789 and 7946 must be open and available
  * IP protocol 50 (ESP) must be enabled

# Ports

Make sure the following ports are available:

```9090: for accessing Exareme```

```(Optional): 8500 for accessing Consul Key Value Store``` 

```(Optional): 9000 for accessing Portainer.io```

# Preparation

## Clone the repository 

Clone this repository on your local computer so you can use it to deploy Exareme.

## Data Structure
In the node in which you will deploy Exareme there should be a *DATA FOLDER* which contains the *DATA* existing in that node. We will refer to the path leading to *DATA FOLDER* as ```data_path```. 

The *DATA FOLDER* should follow a specific structure.
It should contain one folder for each pathology that it has datasets for. Inside that folder there should be:
1) the .csv files that will contain one or more datasets, 
2) the CDEsMetadata.json file for that specific pathology.

For example:

-> Data Folder <br />
------> Dementia <br />
----------> adni.csv <br />
----------> ppmi.csv <br />
----------> CDEsMetadata.json <br />
------> Neuropathology <br />
----------> demo.csv <br />
----------> CDEsMetadata.json <br />

On the current node where Exareme will be deployed, we *must include* the CDEsMetadata.json file for *every pathology* that exists even if it *doesn't contain* any .csv file.
For example:

-> Data Folder <br />
------> Dementia <br />
----------> CDEsMetadata.json <br />
------> Neuropathology <br />
----------> demo.csv <br />
----------> CDEsMetadata.json <br />

For more information on what these files should contain you can see <a href="../Documentation/InputRequirements.md#input-requirements">here</a>.

# Deployment

In the *Local-Deployment/* folder, run the ```deployLocal.sh``` to start the deployment.
You will be prompted to provide any information needed.

## [Optional] Exareme Version 
```This step can be done through the deploy script.```

In the ```Local-Deployment/``` folder create an ```exareme.yaml``` file.

The file should contain the following lines, modify them depending on the version of Exareme you want to deploy.

```
EXAREME_IMAGE: "hbpmip/exareme"
EXAREME_TAG: "v21.3.0"
```

## [Optional] Data path location
```This step can be done through the deploy script.```

In the ```Local-Deployment/``` folder create a ```data_path.txt``` file.

The file should contain the following line, modify it according to the path where your *DATA FOLDER* is.

```
LOCAL_DATA_FOLDER=/home/user/data/
```

## [Optional] Secure Portainer

By default, Portainerâ€™s web interface and API are exposed over HTTP. If you want them to be exposed over HTTPS check
<a href="../Documentation/SecurePortainer.md#optional-secure-portainer">here</a>. Information about how to <a href="../Federated-Deployment/Documentation/Troubleshoot.md#portainer">launch Portainer for the first time.</a>

# Troubleshooting

While ```sudo docker service ls```, if the services are Replicated 0/1:

1) Check that you have enough space in your machine.

2) If there is an ERROR, try ```sudo docker service ps --no-trunc NAME_OR_ID_OF_SERVICE``` to see the whole message.
